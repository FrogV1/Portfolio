	<p>I've been coding for the past year during my free time and have taken many courses and learned enough to be able to make my own websites that look and function great. I'm not perfect, so I have mistakes but I love figuring out how to fix them. I have dabbled in other programming languages over the years as well but found my place in web development with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and ReactJS. I am constantly working on my websites and sometimes can't seem to stop! I also use the SoloLearn app on my phone throughout the day at school to keep me busy.</p>

<h2 style="margin-top: 100px;">About Me</h2>
<p class="aboutme">My name is Tyler, and I am a 17 year old from a very small town called Machiasport, ME. I am a Senior in High School at Washington Academy, and I really like to code. My first interest sparked a couple years ago and ever since then i've always had this magnet that pulls me back to coding. My favorite thing is Web Development and it's what I do best, and I strive from it. I definitley plan to learn much more in the future though and spread to multiple langauges as I improve. </p>
